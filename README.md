# covid_analysis_modelling
## Installation

- The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* 
- All the pre-installed libraries used in this project are listed in requirements.txt file
- Note: This project was done in Kaggle, and these libraries are the default ones available in the current Kaggle kernel. 

### Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Project Motivation
With currently over 140 million confirmed cases and above 3 million deaths worldwide, lockdowns and social distancing have become the new norm. The socio-economic disruption of millions of lives has been unprecedented, with its long-term ramifications yet to be fully understood. 
Hence, it is extremely critical to analyze the spread of the virus for 3 reasons:
- Understanding its worldwide impact: how different countries/regions were affected and how they responded. 
- Enabling the government and concerned authorities to respond appropriately: by modeling the spread of the virus and providing projections for resources required. 
- Prevention - Creation of processes and systems to handle such unforeseen circumstances in the future.
